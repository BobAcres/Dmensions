                    <p class="txt-four">For any item of value you may wish to use as collateral, just bring it in.  You will also need to have a valid government-issued photo I.D.and item Receipt with you.You must be 18 or older.</p>

                    <p class="txt-four">Once we appraise your item, we’ll let you know how much we are able to advance.You walk out with cash while we hold your item. The time period for the loan varies depending on state law. And, when your item is with us, you can be assured that we keep it safe and secure.</p>

                    <p class="txt-four">When you pay off your loan, you can reclaim your item. And if you need more time, no worries. We often can offer you an extension or renewal, as permitted by law. Of course, you can also forfeit your collateral in which case there is nothing further you need to do. Not paying off your loan is a perfectly acceptable course of action. It will not affect your credit score. To retrieve your item, just pay off your loan. It’s that simple.</p>

                        <p> NO, DO NOT SEND US YOUR ITEMS. We get so many letters and gifts from fans in the mail it is impossible for us to separate them out.
