                        <h2>LOAN PROCESS & TERMS</h2>
            
                        <p class="sol-txt">Just looking for a loan? We are always happy to loan you cash for your items and here is how it works...</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>After you bring your item in we settle on a amount that we will loan you today for your item. The Loan contract will be written for 30 days and you will be paid in cash.</li>
                        <li>APPLE PRODUCTS/ELECTRONICS: Be ready to remove any AppleIDâ€™s or other passwords at the counter. All electronics must be fully logged out of any accounts and not password protected.</li>
                        <li>A one time N3000 Fee will also be charged with every new loan, and a N2000 lost ticket fee will be assessed if you require a new pawn ticket.</li>
                        <li>If you do not come back to claim your item before the 30 day loan period expires you can still pick up your item if we still have it in inventory. You will simply pay the additional interest and a N10,000 late fee.</li>
                        <li>Only Cash, Electronic transfers are accepted as payment on a loan.</li>
                        <li>If you are not in town we can arrange payment via mail, just mail us a copy of your ticket, ID and a cashiers check or money order. A new ticket will be mailed back to you.</li>
                        <li>We can also mail your item back after a mail payment, just call us first so we can give you the shipping total to add to your final payment.</li>
                        <li>Just call us during normal business hours 9-5 so we can have your item pulled from the safe and available after hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Any Questions? Email leenda@Email.com or give us a call at +234(703)385-7912. The line can get very busy so we apologize if we miss your call please try again in 10-15 minutes.</p>
